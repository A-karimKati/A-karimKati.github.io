I’m a third year PhD student in computer security at __Mohammed VI Polytechnic University__ [(UM6P) ](https://www.um6p-cs.ma/en/research/) where I’m advised by [Tarik Moataz](https://tarikmoataz.com/).
I am also member of the __Encrypted Search Lab__ [ESL](https://esl.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University and I work closely with [Prof. Seny Kamara](https://cs.brown.edu/people/seny/). 
Recently, I have spent a semester as a visiting researcher at the Cryptography and Engineering Group (__ENCRYPTO__) at TU Darmstadt hosted by [Prof. Dr. Thomas Schneider](https://www.encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de/team_encrypto/thomas_schneider/index.en.jsp).

I work in the area of applied cryptography with a focus on encrypted search where I maintain interest in the design and cryptanalysis of new and existing constructions. 
In particular, I have been recently working on assessing the real-world security implications of existing encrypted search attacks.
