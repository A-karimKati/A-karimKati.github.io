Hi!

I am <span style="color: #008080;font-weight:550;">Karim</span>, a Post-Doctoral Researcher and a member of the [CrySP](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) group at the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo.
I completed my PhD on <span style="color: #333333;font-weight:450;">Applied Cryptography</span> at [SCCS ](https://www.um6p-cs.ma/en/research/)  Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, under the kind supervision of [Tarik Moataz](https://tarikmoataz.com/). 
During that time, I conducted research on privacy and Real-World applications of cryptographic primitives with an emphasis 
on the design and cryptanalysis of efficient Encrypted Search Algorithms (<span style="color: #333333;font-weight:450;">ESA</span>).
In late 2022, I was fortunate enough to undertake a long-term research visit at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt Cryptography and Engineering Group [ENCRYPTO](https://www.encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de/home_page/index.en.jsp) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Thomas Schneider](https://www.encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de/team_encrypto/thomas_schneider/index.en.jsp).
I am also an <span style="color: #333333;font-weight:450;">affiliate research fellow</span> at Brown University Encrypted Search Lab [ESL](https://esl.cs.brown.edu/), where I work closely with [Prof. Seny Kamara](https://cs.brown.edu/people/seny/).
