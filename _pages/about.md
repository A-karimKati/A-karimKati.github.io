I'm a PhD candidate (third year) in __computer security__ and __applied cryptography__ at [SCCS ](https://www.um6p-cs.ma/en/research/)  Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. 
In Jul'20 I also started an affiliate position with Brown University [ESL.](https://esl.cs.brown.edu/)

Broadly, my research focuses on privacy and Real-World applications of cryptography with an emphasis on design and cryptanalysis of efficient __ESA__ "Encrypted Search Algorithms" using techniques from cryptography and algorithms.
My thesis is co-supervised by [Tarik Moataz](https://tarikmoataz.com/) and [Prof. Seny Kamara](https://cs.brown.edu/people/seny/).
